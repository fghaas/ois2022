This workshop explores the basics of the OpenStack SDK in Python.

Hi and welcome, everyone. This is a 90-minute workshop in which I
would like to introduce you to the very basics of the Python OpenStack
SDK.

Now, I want to be very clear about one thing: this is a creative play
session. I am not going to put you through a tutorial. I am not even
going to make suggestions on how you should apply what you're learning
here. I also don't want to discuss what this possibly replaces.

Instead, I want to show you how to get started with the SDK, I want to
show you some things that **I** did with the SDK, and then I want you
to, quite literally, play around with it.

And the reason I am doing this workshop in this manner is that this
conference is probably one of the very few opportunities you get to do
this. I imagine that most of your development work is aimed at a
specific purpose, is defined by a specific task, and probably has a
deadline.

But in order to come up with original ideas, we need to get our minds
into a mood of play. So *that's* what we are going to do.

## Creativity: A Short and Cheerful Guide <!-- .element class="hidden" -->

<!-- Note -->
And in case you're interested in learning more about this approach, I
recommend this really thin book by John Cleese called *Creativity: A
short and cheerful guide*, which has a lot of wonderful ideas about,
as Sir Ken Robinson put it, the process of having original ideas that
have value.
